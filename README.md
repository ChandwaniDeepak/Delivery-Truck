# Delivery Truck

The problem we are trying to solve is like Travelling Salesman problem such that the traveling salesman travels around different points or location in the city to sell his products. He wants to cover all the different locations and points by travelling through the smallest distance.
Our problem is based on Delivery truck which is helping customer get their products, who are situated in different cities across the United States. The truck wants to reach and deliver products to all of its customers in the different cities, while covering the smallest distance possible.
Our program tries to compute different routes which the delivery truck can take, using Genetic Algorithms. Our Genetic Algorithm tries to figure out the smallest route possible by trying different combination of routes possible. We provide an initial route based on which it then tries to converge towards the smallest route possible. As the final output, it displays the best route which the solution has computed and draws it as the output.
